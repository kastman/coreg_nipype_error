Hi all,

I'm troubleshooting a transformation matrix problem using SPM preprocessing in
nipype. This is a basic toy example, but holds for more complex workflows.

I'm using SPM for preprocessing, and in this case using the realign and
coregister interfaces. I'm trying to follow best-practices by only estimating
transformation matrices (which SPM stores in .mat alongside .img and .hdr)
and then only applying the transformations at the end. I turned on
`filemanip_level DEBUG` and can see that nipype **is** correctly copying along the
.mat images, because these are in the .img/.hdr nifti pair format. However,
when I go in to view the images, volumes 2..n are aligned with each other but
not the 1st image, suggesting that something is going wrong with the .mat when
viewing the coregisterd images create by this 2-node nipype workflow:

![Image Coreg](ds107_wordoneback_coreg.png)

When I create jobs and run them using the standard SPM jobmanager the images are
aligned as expected. Note that the realign job I'm using is estwrite, and
specifying that I'm only writing teh mean image (to use as the target for
coreg), but this works the same if I just use 'estimate' and use the first image
as the target.

Nipype 0.10.0

The data are from open-fmri, ds107 word one back test. They are untouched except
for converting to NIFTI_PAIR and renaming with the run number (since SPM doesn't
like images named the same thing).
